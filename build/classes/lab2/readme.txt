INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAB #2 ON ENCAPSULATION
===========================================

You are going to build a simple simulation of a video game. Don't worry, we're
not asking you to write the code for a complete game. What we we need is just
the skeleton code for part of the game. Therefore, we
won't be using too many classes or writing lots of functional code. We're
only interested in class construction with basic properties and some methods,
without only some bare bones implementation code (the body of the method)
to demonstrate mastery of the encapsulation principle. As a guideline, examine
the example4. That's about as much detail as you need.

Create the following classes:

1. A "GameCharacter" class
2. A "Game" class
3. A Startup class with a main method

Provide at least 3 properties for class #1 and #2.

Provide at least 3 methods for class #1 and #2. Make sure at least two
of the methods are to be completed in a specific order. Make sure at least
one method has one or more method parameters.

Create all of the "GameCharacter" objects you will need for your game. You
must think carefully where this object creation should take place.

Create the "Game" object. You must think carefully where this action should
take place.

Now use the "Startup" class to start your game. When you think you've done
things correctly, ask your instructor to review your work on screen. (Time
permitting). Should we run out of time, please print out the source code and
hand in. Make sure your name, date and "Lab2" are indicated in a comment
at the top of the first page.
